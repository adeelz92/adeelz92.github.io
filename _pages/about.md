**Adeel Zafar** is a fourth-year computer science PhD student at the University of Houston advised by [Guoning Chen](https://www2.cs.uh.edu/~chengu/). He is interested in developing scalable frameworks for the extraction, visualization, and analysis of vortices in large-scale turbulent flows. Prior to his PhD, he obtained an MS in software engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), where he was awarded the fully funded Shanghai Government Scholarship, and a BS in software engineering from [NUST](https://nust.edu.pk/). He has also worked as a software engineer at Techlogix Inc. in Islamabad, Pakistan, and as an image algorithm engineer at Mengbaby Inc. in Shanghai, China. Adeel is a fitness enthusiast who enjoys weight training and running in his free time.

Research
======
Adeel Zafarâ€™s research lies at the intersection of **scientific visualization, deep learning, and high-performance computing (HPC)**, with a particular focus on analyzing vortical structures in large-scale turbulent flows. He has developed automated frameworks for the extraction, visualization, and classification of hairpin vortices from turbulent boundary layer flows and published his research in top venues such as IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) and IEEE Visualization (VIS) conference. He is designing parallel algorithms optimized for HPC environments to efficiently extract and classify hairpin vortices from large-scale turbulent simulation datasets. He is also working on creating benchmark datasets for training deep neural networks for multi-class hairpin vortex identification and tracking.
